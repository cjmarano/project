Moved older init and zshrc to Mystuff/Old... Generally cleaned up.
Made sure paths in init.el on New all pointed to ~/project/org/ (tasks, notes, etc.)

Set init.el on Big to init.el_Big_slow then modified init,el - replacing at setopt lines with setq (the older form as used by init.el on New).
Startup time went down by 3 seconds.
