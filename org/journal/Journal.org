Moved older init and zshrc to Mystuff/Old... Generally cleaned up.
Made sure paths in init.el on New all pointed to ~/project/org/ (tasks, notes, etc.)

Set init.el on Big to init.el_Big_slow then modified init,el - replacing at setopt lines with setq (the older form as used by init.el on New).
Startup time went down by 3 seconds.

Playing around with terminals, KItty, Ghost, Weterm. Don't like weterm's Lua for config.
Kitty seems useable. Ghosty may be nice but title issue on New, Big shows directory as title.
Now I want to decide if Tmux is worth learning or if split panes, tabs, mutiple windows that
terminal apps offer are enough.
