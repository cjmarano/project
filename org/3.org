* September.
* _Start times around 6 seconds_, up from 3. Around 9 seconds for Big.
** Why are start times going up? 
** adding back GC changes to init.el and early-init.el cut this to 5+ secs.
** synched init.el on Big and New.
** ran profile-dotemacs.el biggest  % of startup time was org-babel-do-load-languages.
*** commented out rust, eshell and ruby 
*** commented out vterm
*** removed a lot of packages from packages and commented out all rust items but startup times not really shorter
*** restored most itmes back to init.el** added gc change to early init and restore to normal gc to init.el
* Prot emacs runs as GUI on New, as terminal app on Big. Why?
* NEXT Freeze init.el and work on other things.
* new.init.el is latest System Crafters init.el - just to see how it compares w/ mine.
it's okay but nothing special. Do like JetBrainsMono Nerd Font though.
