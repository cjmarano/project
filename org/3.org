* Doing Zsh Scripting.
** No good intros to zsh programming found so far.
** Debugging:
1. Call the script with the -x option. Example: zsh -x myscript.
2. Modify your scripts header to include -x. Example: #!/bin/zsh -x.
3. Turn on debugging in certain parts of your code. Example: #!/usr/bin/env zsh set - x.
