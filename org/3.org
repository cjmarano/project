* September.
* _Start times around 5 seconds_, up from 3. Around 8 seconds for Big.
** adding back GC changes to init.el and early-init.el cut this to 5+ secs.
* Why are start times going up?
** ran profile-dotemacs.el biggest  % of startup time was org-babel-do-load-languages.
*** commented out rust, eshell and ruby.
*** commented out vterm.
*** removed a lot of packages from packages and commented out all rust items but startup times not really shorter.
*** restored most itmes back to init.el
*** added gc change to early init and restore to normal gc to init.el
* Prot emacs runs as GUI on New, as terminal app on Big. Why?
* NEXT Freeze init.el and work on other things.
