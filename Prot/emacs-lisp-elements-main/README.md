# Emacs Lisp Elements

A book that provides big picture view of the Emacs Lisp programming
language by combining prose with code. The goal is to give readers an
idea of how Elisp works by showing some of the main concepts or
patterns discernible in everyday code.

Some chapters are beginner-friendly, while others dive into deeper
waters. Though I think everything is still approachable, as I try to
explain basic concepts and take things one step at a time.

The book is not meant to be a replacement for the built-in Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual. It simply gives you enough information to reason
about Elisp. Once you start extending Emacs, the rest will follow
naturally.

I hope you enjoy it and continue to have fun with Emacs.
