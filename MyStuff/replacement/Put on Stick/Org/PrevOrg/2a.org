There are several directories.
Yasnippet package is in ~/.emacs.d/plugins/yashippet
~/.emacs.d/elpa/yasnippet* (there are 3 different packages).

~/.emacs.d/snippets is empty. <-- yes, it is. Delete?
Yasnippet github page says snippet go in ~/.emacs.d/snippets.
Used customize to add ~/.emacs.d/snippets.

Deleted ~/.cache/emacs/etc/yasnippet/snippets from yas-snippet-dirs

Guessing that user-created snippets to in ~/.emacs.d/yassnippet so leave it.
only other snippet dir currently enabled is ~/,emacs.d/elpa/elpy-20230402.1946/snippets

had to change on Big *again* disabled every yas-sniipet-dir and changed all to ~/,emacs.d/elpa/elpy-20230402.1946/
 See below.

* Yasnippet two.
Deleted all dirs from yas-snippet-dirs then added by name from ~/.emacs.d/elpa
note: one dir in elpa would not load. Now, that directory is gone after updating yas-snippet-dirs.
Are these dirs *created* by the variable?

Disabling Flymake (toward bottom of init.el) was spelled wrong. Fixing spelling disabled Flymake.
Not seeing the correct pop-ups when in Python mode. What went wrong. They were there.

* DONE Python: on Round, pyright and lsp-mode appears to be working properly.
** it looks like adding (use-package eglot) to (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
appears to have corrected the issue and I now see pop-up box when I type code in a .py file.

pylsp server was still running? but was not installed?

Should be using python-language-server not older pylsp

Once the pylsp server was stopped lsp worked as intended.
I keep getting warningas about flake8 but flake8 is up to date.

Kept getting errors. Installed pyright (via pip) and lsp-pyright (emacs package).

The following clients were selected based on priority: (server-id pyright, priority 2)

* Had to clean $PATH on Big and add the correct ~/.pyenv/shims location so pyright would be recognized.




* On Big - snippets missing AGAIN.
Oh, they're back. After restarting Emcas. Weird.


* On Round python seems to show correct completions and suggestions/help.

* On Round - went back to early System Crafters setup.
Merged it wth Round's init.el to see if I could get a cleaner init.el
changes include adding org-babel.
** Need to test to see of everything works correctly.


* Started with old, working, init.el removed things..,
** Followed https://www.adventuresinwhy.com/posts/eglot
Installed pyslp via pip added the executable to the path
~/.pyenv/shims/
Had to do the --trusted-host thing to get pip to install
cleaned up (commented out) a lot of Python stuff then followed instruction for above website.
** Python code suggestions and expanded descriptions now work.
** Need to see if all completion frameworks are functioning;
Company, lsp-up, tree-sitter, eglot, etc.


*  <2023-12-15 Fri> Went back to original init.el Eglot and tree-sitter now working.
** I'm now seeing suggested completions and company info on Round.
** Seeing same situation on Big. Eglot and Tree-sitter working.
