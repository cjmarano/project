is tree-sitter working as well? Yes, after some adjustments.
Note:   ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter directory on Big and Round may not be needed.

Load time went from less than 4 seconds to over 10 seconds.
Worth it?
** Will probably try on Big.
* DONE Added early-init.el and auto-complete to Big.

this changed load time from 3.4 to 4.6 secs. Acceptable.

says, No language registered for major mode ‘python-mode’)
** On Plucky re-starting server fixed issue.
** On Round, M-x lsp-mode fixed issue. Sort of
*** lsp-mode started the pylsp server and everyting worked.
LSP :: Connected to [pylsp:39423/starting /Users/charles.marano/python].
still seems buggy,
** On Big, things just work. What's different?
[eglot] Waiting in background for server `EGLOT (python/(python-mode python-ts-mode))'
[eglot] Connected! Server `pylsp' now managing `(python-mode python-ts-mode)' buffers in project `python'.
still seems buggy - hit or miss.
** Synced Round to working init on Big.
** after sync buffer still needed M-x lsp-mode to function correctly.

*** Why does pylsp need to be manually started for the buffer?
Tree-stter mode killed pylsp. Restarting wiht lsp-mode fixed it but why did it stop.
rebuilt language grammer for python. it's in:
~/.cache/emacs/tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-python.dylib

added:
(require 'lsp-mode)
(add-hook 'python-ts-mode-hook #'lsp)
(add-hook 'rust-ts-mode-hook #'lsp)

to Round. Will check to see if that resolved issue. It did not.

** pip install -trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org   --upgrade pip
pip install -trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org python-lsp-server[all]

lsp-mode still not starting automatically.

** try adding an :init section to the lsp-mode hooks section above.
* DONE Synched brew installs on Big. Round.

Various fails. Wound up backing out of most of the changes.

** After adding:

(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Hack" :height 180)

;; Set the fixed pitch face
(set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "Hack" :height 180)

;; Set the variable pitch face
(set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "Iosevka Nerd Font Propo" :height 180 :weight 'regular)

Not Sure. Iosevka is too narrow. Inconsolata isnt bad. Will leave it at"Inconsolata LGC Nerd Font" for now.
* NEXT Denote, Rust and Python.
** TODO things to test.
*** Python appears to be working as of 19AUG2024.
Well... Python was working on Round but not Big so...
Copied init.el from Round to Big.
Installed all packages that were on Round onto Big.
Had to run M-x eglot to get things started.
*** Need to test Rust.
** If I load a rust program main.rs alone eglot fails
to set up workspace.
If I load the associated cargo.toml first then open the main.rs
I don't get a message about eglot.
This is probably a Project issue. Look at emacs projects.
