M-x projectile-discover-projects-in-directory

(setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/projects/" "~/work/" ("~/github" . 1)))

Just open some file in a version-controlled (e.g. git) or a project (e.g. maven) directory that’s recognized by Projectile and you’re ready for action.

So... not currently usefull

** Tried Prot's setup - didn't work. Went back to System Crafters, still issues.

** Also, on Round langs are in ~/.cache/emacs/var/tree-sitter  instead of ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter
*** Commented out all references to Tree-Sitter and un-installed Tree-sitter. Should be built in. Will test.
Seems to work for Python. Ruby gives error, want Solargraph (Launguage server for Ruby? Don't know).
Installing Solargraph Make failed. Usual cert issues. Make failed after re-installing Ruby.
Tried brew install Solargraph. Appears to be working.
(Note Make failed for ruby install Solargrah because:
"current directory: /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0/gems/racc-1.7.3/ext/racc/cparse

* NEXT Doom Modeline Enab
- State "DONE"       from "NEXT"       [2024-05-31 Fri 13:44]
led more items. Modeline is more informative but...
Org mode (here) showing an a with a carrot over instead of a circle. Weird. Okay. It worked after a restart.

Note: ob-rust necessay because org-babel is active.

** Added to doom modeline minor-modes t and lsp-t
added more:

#+begin_src  emacs-lisp

(setq doom-modeline-major-mode-color-icon t)
(setq doom-modeline-buffer-state-icon t)
(setq doom-modeline-minor-modes t)
;; (setq doom-modeline-lsp t)
(setq doom-modeline-lsp-icon t)

#+end_src

** Doom-Modeline was showing icons, isn't now. The items I added may have killed that.

added doom-modeline-env-enable-rust and doom-modeline-env-enable-ruby to init.el

** Still only seeing icons when it's a Python File.

had to re-add pkg-info. no idea why.



* Set up Rust again on Round.
** Set up Rust again on Big.

rustup update on both.

also ran brew cleanup and brew doctor.

Installed are; ob-rust flycheck-for-rust org-babel-rust (approx names).

Installed rustic. Some variables mentioned in rustic docs not found.
rustic was last updated in 2022 so may not be as up-to-date as it could be.

Rustic appears to be working correctly.


* Rust is extremely frustrating.
syntax is obscure.
will skip rustlings for now and try Basics excercizes.


* NOTE: init.el on Round and Big. --> enabled Tree-sitter.
it appears to be working correctly.

* Installed ruby 3.3.2 via brew but which reports 2.6.10 so ran brew re-install ruby.

By default, binaries installed by gem will be placed into:
  /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/3.3.0/bin

You may want to add this to your PATH.

ruby is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have ruby first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find ruby you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/ruby/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/ruby/include"

For pkg-config to find ruby you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/lib/pkgconfig"

  Re-install powerlevel10k, ruby, chruby on Big after moving .zshrc from Round to Big.
  Round had all the homebrew stuff in a non-standard location so re-installed everything on big
  in the same location, which was silly. Should have fixed Round's non-standard location.


** rbenv will let me choose ruby 3.3.2 as opposed to built in 2.6.5
use rbenv local <version number> so as not to mess with OS X's built in ruby stuff.
* Re-installed colorls ruby, rbenv,powerlevel10k on Round.
zsh now throws no errors on Round or Big.
.zshrc on Round is now cleanest version.
* init.el on Round mysteriously blew-up. Could not find problem.
wound up copying Big init to Round then commenting out blocks until I found the issue.
wound up with a diferent init on Round. Will do a diff with Big's init to see what's going on.
Did diff w/ init.el from Big and only issue I found was with exec path.
** Commented out lines 179 to 185 in init.el on Round.
No idea why this throws an error but commenting out resolved issue.

* Copied init.el from Round to init.el_freeze_06JUNE2024
and moved a copy to OneDrive.
