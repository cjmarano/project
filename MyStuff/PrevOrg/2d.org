30 works but having trouble creating a launcher using Automator.
emacs 30 can be lauched using an Applescript that I created in
Automator but the Script also throws an error.

Not sure why but it *looks* like emacs+ made changes to init.el when it was installed.
Did not keep copy of the broken init.el that resulted.

* DONE updated the emacs *app*
