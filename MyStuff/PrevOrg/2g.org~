Tried re-installing. Didn't fix.
Will check init.el
So tried editing init.el with no results but did fix some other issues
Round comiles init.el every time a change to it is saved.
Edited init.el in nano. Can now see org-bullets BUT still get garbage
chars at end of headlines - when they're collapsed. Expanding
headlines removes the garbage chars. Somehow org-bullets section
of init.el was ;; out. fixed that, then lost the Trefoil.png in Dashboard.
Finally reverted init.el on Round to an older version then did an
ediff between the init.el on Big and the init.el on Round.

That appeared to fix all issues and init.el on Round seems to be
working properly. Will double-check init.el on round to make sure.

zshrc_best_21OCT2024 is now the definitive zshrc. Is in OneDrive.
** TODO Need to compare it w/ Big's zshrc and rationalize.
** TODO Need to copy it to Ducky and Plucky and the 14 in MacBook.
Cleaned dupe entries from PATH in .zshrc on both Big and Round.

entry in .zshrc:
source /usr/local/share/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme
does seem to be executed but removing it does not affect much.
commenting it out does not see to make any difference.
