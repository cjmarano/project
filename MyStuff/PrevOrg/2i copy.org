** same as Rust, Eglot can't find pylsp.
** Problem with eglot-server
** Making many temp. changes to see if this can be fixed.
*** 1st wave of changes did not resolve can't find pylsp issue.
** pylsp is in .pyenv/shims/pylsp on Big
but is in /opt/homebrew/bin/ on New.
removed pylsp from homebrew and installed it via pip to:
/Users/charles.marano/.pyenv/shims/pylsp
*** this did not resolve the issue.
Homogulated brew installs on New.
Many libs and applications were not on New that were on Big.
** thinking about chopping down init.el and starting over.
*** on New, just simplify. Save old init.el in case.
** Installing pyright (pip install pyright) suppressed lsp message and
two python files opened with tree-sitter support.
** Message came back after I had to revert to olderinit.el
*** Ran pip install "python-lsp-server[all]"
 This appeared to work. Will test further.
** Fixed.
eglot] Waiting in background for server ‘EGLOT (python/(python-mode python-ts-mode))’
[eglot] Connected! Server ‘pylsp’ now managing ‘(python-mode python-ts-mode)’ buffers in project ‘python’.
* DONE As of 28 Feb init.el on NEW: python working.
** created ~/.tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python/

* Rust threw errors.
** Opening the Cargo.toml for the program before opening the src/main.rs file
appears to have resolved the issue:
[eglot] Connected! Server ‘rust-analyzer’ now managing ‘(rustic-mode)’ buffers in project ‘project’.
Not getting completions though. Syntax highlighting appears to be working correctly.
** Eglot was using Rustic so rust-analyzer is a change.
** Eglot does not support the rust-analyzer extensions to the language-server protocol
and does not aim to do so in the future. 
* How necessary is Magit? Yasnippet? Projectile? Consult? Eldoc for ielm? Elpy? Org Roam?
** Possibly create a separate init.el with only basics or dupe init.el then comment out large sections of it, test, and restore as necessary.
