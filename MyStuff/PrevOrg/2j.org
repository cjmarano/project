** Even though marginalia package not installed. .
Tree-sitter can't find language grammer _file ending in .so_ long standing problems.
** Look at ~/.tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python/ that's got everything.

* DONE Installed org-modern to see if it can replace custom org.

**  Didn't care for it's look.
* DONE Copyied 3 dylibs from ~/tree-sitter/ to ~/.cache/emacs/tree-sitter/
** seems to have resolved issue. I don't see marginalia though (additional .el needed ?)

** tested storing custom items in ~/.custom but lost that. Re-do?
** Removed several items from init.el on New.
Will use to seems if they made any substantial difference. Load time down
from 8-12 seconds to 2-4 seconds.
** Eglot w/ flymake seems to work on emacs-solo init.el but:
completeions and marginalia either don't work or work way differently.

** Trimmed emacs-solo down (kept originals untouched) it works, loads fast but needs other trims and adjustments.
* NEXT Will look at simplifying init.el as per System Crafters.
** DONE Python works fine with completion and marginalia.

**  
* WAITING Rust threw errors.
** DONE Newer rust IDE setup found but uses older tools:
- State "DONE"       from "WAITING"    [2025-03-21 Fri 08:56]
https://arjenwiersma.nl/notes/rust-emacs/
This setup failed out of box no syntax highlighting.
*** DONE Delete rust analyzer refs in the init.el?
- State "DONE"       from "WAITING"    [2025-03-21 Fri 08:56]
and does not aim to do so in the future. 
*** DONE Rust doesn't do completions or marginalia.
- State "DONE"       from "WAITING"    [2025-03-21 Fri 08:56]
*** NEXT How about delete all rust items, start from scratch?
*** See: https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-rust-analyzer/
*** Opening the Cargo.toml for the program before opening the src/main.rs file
appears to have resolved the issue:
[eglot] Connected! Server ‘rust-analyzer’ now managing ‘(rustic-mode)’ buffers in project ‘project’.
Not getting completions though. Syntax highlighting appears to be working correctly.
** DONE Really annoyed that Rust programming intro was not up to date.

compiler complained that rnd methods shown in intro were deprecated.
Will pause work on rust and focus on Python.
** Eglot was using Rustic so rust-analyzer is a change.
*** Removed all rust items then installed from
https://unwoundstack.com/blog/emacs-as-a-rust-ide.html
his rust config using eglot clippy flymake but not rustic or rust-ts-mode.
appears to work well. will see using. config was from 7/30/23 so maybe
look for something more recent with ts-mode, eglot, etc.
*** why didn't I like it? Probably because no completions or marginalia.
** Eglot does not support the rust-analyzer extensions to the language-server protocol
Maybe that's why things aren't working.
** used info in https://rust-analyzer.github.io/book/other_editors.html#eglot
this gave eglot with a main.rs file and eglot menu.
** so no completions or marginalia with Rust yet.
** had issues with rustic-mode-map:
 (setq rustic-lsp-client 'eglot)
   ;; :bind (:map rustic-mode-map
   ;;     ("M-j" . lsp-ui-imenu)
   ;;     ("M-?" . lsp-find-references)
   ;;     ("C-c C-c s" . lsp-rust-analyzer-status)
   ;;     ("C-c C-c l" . flycheck-list-errors)
   ;;     ("C-c C-c a" . lsp-execute-code-action)
   ;;     ("C-c C-c r" . lsp-rename)
   ;;     ("C-c C-c q" . lsp-workspace-restart)
   ;;     ("C-c C-c Q" . lsp-workspace-shutdown))
-- looks like the :bind or :map is messed up.
-- how about using keymap-global-set instead?

* NEXT Monday, March 31st emacs hung on launch.
** Hung after loading yasnippets successfuly.
 This was after package-list-packages and a message from emacs
 that 17 packages needed to be removed via package-autoremove.
 Tried older init.el didn't work. Issue was obviously with a deleted
 package that was needed.
 Commented out large sections of init.el got emacs running then
 uncommented section by section.
 Startup time was less than 3 seconds.
 Org-babel, org-tempo still commented out. Those areas may be then
 problem.
 
** After removing Org-babel and Org-tempo got under 3 sec. starts.
*** Python programs working 100% with completion and marginalia.
** Eglot shows active in both python and rust.
