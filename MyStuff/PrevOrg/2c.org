** Set up Rust again on Big.

rustup update on both.

also ran brew cleanup and brew doctor.

Installed are; ob-rust flycheck-for-rust org-babel-rust (approx names).

Installed rustic. Some variables mentioned in rustic docs not found.
rustic was last updated in 2022 so may not be as up-to-date as it could be.

Rustic appears to be working correctly.

zsh now throws no errors on Round or Big.
.zshrc on Round is now cleanest version.
[2024-06-06 Thu 13:45]* init.el on Round mysteriously blew-up. Could not find problem.
wound up copying Big init to Round then commenting out blocks until I found the issue.
wound up with a diferent init on Round. Will do a diff with Big's init to see what's going on.
Did diff w/ init.el from Big and only issue I found was with exec path.
** Commented out lines 179 to 185 in init.el on Round.
No idea why this throws an error but commenting out resolved issue.

* DONE NOTE: init.el on Round and Big. --> enabled Tree-sitter.

By default, binaries installed by gem will be placed into:
  /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/3.3.0/bin

You may want to add this to your PATH.

ruby is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have ruby first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find ruby you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/ruby/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/ruby/include"

For pkg-config to find ruby you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/lib/pkgconfig"

  Re-install powerlevel10k, ruby, chruby on Big after moving .zshrc from Round to Big.
  Round had all the homebrew stuff in a non-standard location so re-installed everything on big
  in the same location, which was silly. Should have fixed Round's non-standard location.


** rbenv will let me choose ruby 3.3.2 as opposed to built in 2.6.5
use rbenv local <version number> so as not to mess with OS X's built in ruby stuff.
* DONE Next: retest Python, Lisp, Ruby and Rust on Big and Round.

or dependencies.

** Big is /opt/homebrew/bin/sbcl Round is /usr/loca/bin/sbcl.
** SBCL -- on Big is /opt/homebrew/bin/sbcl

** also Quicklisp seems to be a problem with setup - no Quicklisp setup.
** on Round it's /usr/local/bin/sbcl

This is due to Round being Intel and Big being Apple silicon and is deliberate.

No idea what happened but top 60% gone. Had to restore init.el from Big to Round then
mod it. Lost all the work on rust put in.
***  [2024-06-14 Fri 09:57] re-synched .zshrc and init.el on Big and Round.
Note: homebrew location still different since Apple Silicon has brew in /opt/homebrew and Intel
Mac has brew in /usr/local.
*** [2024-06-17 Mon] synched inits again (Big and Round)

* DONE Copied init.el to init.el_working

** Check capture templates.
Key combo is C-c, C-, then choose from list. Done!
Okay. Now typing <li TAB gives lisp code block, <p TAB gives Python code block, etc. 

#+begin_ruby
#+end_ruby

#+begin_src python
#+end_src

** NOT working on Big. Same init.el on both. What's going on?

#+begin_src lisp

#+end_src
** Okay, now it IS working on Big. No idea what's going on here.

/usr/local/bin/clisp:8: unmatched "
so re-installed clisp via brew into: /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/clisp
then created a symbolic link to that clisp in /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/clisp
but now clisp not found! had to chmod +x in /usr/local/Cellar/clisp/2.49.92_1/bin
clisp now can be found with wich command but unmatched " is back.
** Clisp now shows as /user/local/bin error remains.
did a bunch of looking but can't find the file that contains the error.
same .zshrc works fine on Big.
[2024-06-13 Thu 09:57]* Had to re-synch init.el on Big and Round again.
June 13 init in OneDrive is current best.

* DONE Org-Babel

(add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("rb" . "ruby"))

-- Don't work. doing <li TAB for instance does offer completions but doesn't show the template
(should expand into #+begin_src lisp) Not sure why.
#+begin_src 

#+end_src
NOTE: default (built in) templates do work.
#+latex:

Okay, that's weird. tried changing lisp to Capital L. typin <L TAB got me Latex.

Now fixed. No idea how. see  ~/OneDrive - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc/1_notes.org

#+begin_src ruby
#+end_src

* Fooling around with Projectile.
** Changed init:
;;  (keymap-set projectile-mode-map "C-x p" 'projectile-command-map)
  (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "s-p") 'projectile-command-map)
(projectile-mode +1)

.git folders are projects by default.
add .projectile to a folder to make it a project.
cargo.toml files inidicate project folder
* Changed user-emacs-directory
** Changed it to ~/.cache/emacs/


* So structure templates now working as intended.

#+begin_src lisp

#+end_src

#+begin_python

#+end_python

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

#+begin_src 

#+end_src
* Put a clean copy of init into git.
Should be possible to pull it down on the little Macbook and Plucky.


* Add to init.el ?
(advice-add 'org-refile :after 'org-save-all-buffers)

Around structure templates:

(with-eval-after-load 'org
)


* Tried org-modern - didn't like.
** Could have been I didn't tweak it correctly but not impressed.
not worth wasting time with.
